### Introduction
1. Supervised Learning: Given a data set and correct output, find the relationship between the intput and output.
  * Regression: Predict results within a continuous output
  * Classification: Predict results in a discrete output
2. Unsupervised Learning: Derive the structure from data and no feedback based on prediciton results.
  * Clustering: Find a way to automatically group the data
  * Non-clustering: "Cocktail Party Algorithm"

### Model and Cost Function
